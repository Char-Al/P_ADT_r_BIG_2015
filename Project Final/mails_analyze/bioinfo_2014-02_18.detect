	Hello,

=======
Le paragraphe 2 est en : ENG
	Please find below the description of an open PhD position on 'Network 
analyses of the impact of a quick dietary shift in the gut microbiome of 
the lizard species, Podarcis sicula'

=======
Le paragraphe 3 est en : ENG
	This PhD proposal aims at determining what it takes (in terms of 
microbiome changes) to become an herbivorous lizard in less than 35 years.

=======
Le paragraphe 4 est en : ENG
	Most lizards are insectivorous. Yet, several species and populations of 
lacertid lizards have evolved toward an omnivorous or even herbivorous 
diet. Our model system, Podarcis sicula, a lizard species has shown 
rapid evolution of feeding and digestive tract morphology in manipulated 
populations. In 1970, five breeding pairs of the insectivorous P. sicula 
were transferred from the islet of Pod Kopište to the islet of Pod 
Mraru, Croatia. 36 years later (representing about 30 P. sicula 
generations), the transplanted P. sicula on Pod Mraru had become mostly 
herbivorous. This dietary shift resulted in changes in head size and 
bite force among the populations on the two islands, and most striking 
changes in the lizards guts, since the herbivorous Pod Mraru lizards had 
developed an elaborate hindgut chamber with cecal valves, which had not 
been seen in any other population of P. sicula. These valves facilitate 
plant digestion by the gut microbial community of the lizard hosts. With 
the advances of next generation sequencing, this system offers a unique 
opportunity to investigate the impact of this dietary change at the 
level of the microbiome using metagenomic and metranscriptomic data. We 
will take advantage of the inclusive powerful comparative framework 
offered by sequence similarity networks, and exploit concepts of graph 
theory, to analyze the functioning and the evolution of genetic 
diversity of the lizard gut microbiomes in such massive datasets. In 
short, we will address the following questions through a comparison of 
the gut microbiomes of insular herbivorous lizards and of their 
insectivorous relatives:

=======
Le paragraphe 5 est en : ENG
	1) Does the taxonomy of the microbiome correlates with the diet?
2) What changes in gene content and functions did the dietary shift 
produce? In particular, what gene families were acquired/lost during 
this transition?
3) What role did the gut mobilome play in these functional changes?
4) Overall, were the changes mostly functional (and through lateral gene 
transfer) or taxonomical (through a deep change of the microbial 
populations)

=======
Le paragraphe 6 est en : ENG
	To tackle these issues, the candidate’s main goal will be to use and 
develop novel exploratory methods, based on sequence similarity graphs 
to describe and compare the taxonomical and functional diversity of 
metagenomes and metatranscriptomes of gut microbiomes of lizards, and to 
assess the possible impact of lateral gene transfer within this 
microbial community in this remarkable adaptive shift.

Le paragraphe 7 est en : ENG
	He/ she will work within a consortium of friendly herpetologists 
(Anthony Herrel), computer scientists (Philippe Lopez) and evolutionary 
microbiologists (Eric Bapteste), and be hosted in the University Pierre 
and Marie Curie and in the National Museum of Natural History, in Paris.

=======
Le paragraphe 8 est en : ENG
	Ideally, the candidate should have some background in bio-informatics 
(to use and improve our labs existing tools) and a strong interest for 
evolutionary biology. He/she will benefit from a Labex BCDiv grant 
(1757€ /month for 3 years.) and will be enrolled in the doctoral program 
at the Muséum National d’Histoire Naturelle in Paris with a start date 
of September 1st 2014.

=======
Le paragraphe 9 est en : ENG
	Potential candidates should send a CV, two letters of recommendation, a 
pdf copy of their master’s thesis, and a letter of motivation in English 
to Eric Bapteste (eric.bapteste@snv.jussieu.fr) or Philippe Lopez 
(philippe.lopez@snv.jussieu.fr) and Anthony Herrel 
(anthony.herrel@mnhn.fr). The applications will be closed June 20, 2014. 
The three top-ranked candidates will be invited for an interview.
