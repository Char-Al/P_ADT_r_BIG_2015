	PSC 2014 is the 19th event of the Prague Stringology Club. It is an
international conference focusing on stringology and related areas. It
is organized annually by the Prague Stringology Club, a research group
in the Department of Theoretical Computer Science at the Faculty of
Information Technology of Czech Technical University in Prague. The
proceedings of recent conferences are indexed in Thomson Reuters,
Scopus and DBLP.

	TOPICS:

=======
Le paragraphe 11 est en : ENG
	Stringology is a part of algorithmic research that deals with the
processing of text strings. It has existed for at least thirty years
and developed into a respected subfield of its own. The last twenty
years have produced an explosion of new results. This progress is due
in part to the human genome effort, an area to which string algorithms
make important contributions. String processing extends into tree
processing that is called Arbology. The topics of the conference
include but are not limited to:

=======
Le paragraphe 12 est en : ENG
	   * algorithms for pattern matching in strings, images and trees
   * data structures (automata, trees etc.) for pattern matching
     in strings, images and trees
   * coding and data compression
   * bioinformatics
   * information retrieval
   * string processing algorithms in databases
   * searching for regularities
   * natural language processing

proceedings are prepared for the conference. They are published by
Czech Technical University in Prague and are also available from the
PSC web pages. Selected papers from the later workshops were also
published in a special issue of the journal Kybernetika. Selected
papers from the 2002-2006, 2008 conferences were then published in the
Nordic Journal of Computing, Journal of Automata, Languages, and
Combinatorics, International Journal of Foundations in Computer
Science, and Discrete Applied Mathematics.
