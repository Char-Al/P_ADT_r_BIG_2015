IMPORTANT DATES
Paper submission:  January 15th, 2015

Le paragraphe 4 est en : ENG
	*DESCRIPTION*
Currently, more and more data are collected from multiple sources or  
represented by multiple views (e.g., text, video, images, biological  
data, among others). In this context, clustering techniques are often  
required to be able to provide several possibilities for analyzing the  
data. As a consequence, in recent years, the interdisciplinary  
research topic on multiple clusterings has drawn significant attention  
of the data mining community.

=======
Le paragraphe 5 est en : ENG
	The research in such a field encompasses those of well-established  
areas, such as cluster ensemble, multi-objective clustering,  
multi-view clustering and constraint-based clustering. In this special
session, we aim at bringing together researchers from these areas to  
discuss questions in multiple clusterings.

=======
Le paragraphe 6 est en : ENG
	*TOPICS*
Papers must present original work or review the state-of-the-art in  
the following non-exhaustive list of topics:

=======
Le paragraphe 7 est en : ENG
	- Cluster ensemble
- Multi-objective clustering
- Multi-view clustering
- Constraint-based clustering
- Semi-supervised clustering
- Model selection and visualization
- Applications (e.g., document mining, bioinformatics, marketing,  
among others)
