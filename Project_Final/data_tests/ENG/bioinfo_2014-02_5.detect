	OBJECTIVES
----------

==========================================
Le paragraphe 7 est en : ENG
	SASB aims at promoting discussions and collaborations between biologists
(modelers), computer scientists and applied-mathematicians interested in
designing or using methods to reduce the complexity of modeling, simulating or
analyzing biological systems.

==========================================
Le paragraphe 8 est en : ENG
	Static analysis refers to a wide range of techniques for characterizing and 
identifying important features from a model without its exhaustive execution.
Static analysis is used for helping the design of models, the test of models
against experimental data, and the prediction of behaviors.

==========================================
Le paragraphe 9 est en : ENG
	Static analyzes can involve, for instance, modeling paradigms, such as
rule-based modeling, that ease the characterization of the behaviors of a
model; abstractions that prevent a full exploration of the potential concrete
behaviors; algebraic representations and transformations that ease the 
computation of various properties; model reductions, that decrease the 
dimension of a model while preserving important behaviors; characterization of 
dynamical properties with respect to the topology of the model; etc.

==========================================
Le paragraphe 10 est en : FRA
	SCOPE
-----

==========================================
Le paragraphe 11 est en : ENG
	The program of SASB 2014 will consist mainly of presentations of refereed
papers and invited talks. Contributions are welcomed on all aspects about the 
use of static analysis methods in Systems Biology, including, but not limited 
to: 
  * static analysis frameworks,
  * model reduction,
  * model decomposition,
  * algebraic representations,
  * state space compaction,
  * abstractions of dynamics,
  * link between topology and dynamics,
  * languages for compact description of biological models,
  * modeling or data integration experiences using static analysis,
  * informal methods (that could be candidate to formalization),
  * challenges for tackling complexity of biological models.
