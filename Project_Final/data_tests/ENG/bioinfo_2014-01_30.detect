	FMMB 2014 - 1st INTL. CONFERENCE ON FORMAL METHODS IN MACRO-BIOLOGY
   Call for Papers
   September 22-24, 2014
   Noumea, New Caledonia
   http://fmmb2014.sciencesconf.org/
* AIMS AND SCOPE
   The purpose of FMMB is to bring together researchers, developers,
   and students in theoretical computer science, applied mathematics,
   mathematical and computational biology, interested in studying the
   application of formal methods to the construction and analysis of
   models describing biological processes at both micro and macro levels.
   The topics of interest include (but are not limited to):
   - representation and analysis of biological systems in formal systems
     such as:
       o ordinary and partial differential equation systems,
       o discrete event systems, infinite state systems,
       o hybrid discrete-continuous systems, hybrid automata,
       o cellular automata, multi-agent systems,
       o stochastic processes, stochastic games,
       o statistical physics models,
       o process algebras, process calculi,
       o rewriting systems, graph grammars,
   - coupling models and data, inference of models from data,
   - computability and complexity issues,
   - modelling and analysis tools, case studies.
   Application areas particularly solicited include:
   - environmental biology, ecology, marine science,
   - agriculture and forestry,
   - developmental biology, population biology,
   - epidemiology, medicine,
   - systems biology, synthetic biology.
* KEYNOTE SPEAKERS
   Pieter Collins,  Maastricht University, Netherlands,
   Saso Dzeroski,   Jozef Stefan Institute, Slovenia,
   Radu Grosu,      Vienna Technical University, Austria,
   Steffen Klamt,   Max Planck Institute Magdeburg, Germany,
   Pietro Lio',     Cambridge University, UK,
   Hélène Morlon,   Ecole Polytechnique and CNRS, France.
* PC CO-CHAIRS
   François Fages,  Inria Paris-Rocquencourt, France,
   Carla Piazza,    University of Udine, Italy.
* LOCAL CHAIR
   Teodor Knapik,   University of New Caledonia.
* IMPORTANT DATES
   Submission deadline:    April 25
   Author notification:    June 4
   Camera-ready copy due:  June 25
* SUBMISSION AND PUBLICATION
   Regular submissions of 12-20 pages or short submissions of 2 pages
   in LNCS style should be submitted as PDF files via EasyChair
   https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fmmb2014 .
   All accepted papers will be published in a book in the LNBI series of
   Springer-Verlag. Authors of the most significant contributions will
   be invited to submit extended versions for a journal special issue.
