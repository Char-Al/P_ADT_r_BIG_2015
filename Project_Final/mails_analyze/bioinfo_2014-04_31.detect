Subject : [bioinfo] Postdoctoral positions in theoretical population genetics in UC Berkeley 


+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Le paragraphe 1 est en : ENG
	Postdoctoral positions in Montgomery Slatkin's lab (University of California, Berkeley)

==========================================
Le paragraphe 2 est en : ENG
	There are two NIH-足&#8208;funded postdoctoral positions open in my laboratory for theoretical population geneticists. I am looking for people who have training in analytic theory and have programming skills in Python R or Perl and a low-足&#8208;level language such as C, C++ or Java. Research areas include the population genetics of humans, Neanderthals and Denisovans, models of range expansions, genomic tests of inbreeding and relatedness, and genomic tests of soft and hard selective sweeps. The lab will continue to collaborate on the Neanderthal Genome Project but there will be opportunities to work in other research areas as well. The initial appointment will be for two years with the possibility of renewal for up to two more years. The initial salary will be $50,000 per year with health insurance provided. The starting date is negotiable but must be within three years of when the Ph. D. or equivalent degree was awarded. 

==========================================
Le paragraphe 3 est en : ENG
	Qualified applicants should send a current CV and the names and email addresses of three references to slatkin@berkeley.edu. 

==========================================
Le paragraphe 4 est en : ENG
	Montgomery Slatkin, Department of Integrative Biology, University of California, Berkeley.
