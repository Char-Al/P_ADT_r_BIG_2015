Le paragraphe 6 est en : english
	DNA metabarcoding is a rapidly evolving method for assessing biodiversity
from environmental DNA. It has a wide range of applications: biodiversity
monitoring, animal diet assessment, reconstruction of paleo communities,
among others. DNA metabarcoding relies on molecular techniques such
as PCR and next generation sequencing, and requires bioinformatics and
biostatistics competence to analyze sequencing results. This approach
integrates several scientific areas and requires a broad range of
skills, in addition to the classical ecological knowledge related to
the considered research topic.

==========================================
Le paragraphe 7 est en : english
	The DNA metabarcoding spring school is now in its third edition and this
year it is co-organized by the metabarcoding.org team and the Research
School in Biosystematics - ForBio in Tromsø, Norway. Also this year,
the school is divided into two parts.

==========================================
Le paragraphe 8 est en : english
		- The DNA metabarcoding spring school (31 March - 3 April 2014), 
        that will be held during four days at the Skibotn Field Station,
	- A two-day workshop at the Tromsø University Museum 
       that will follow the course (4 - 5 April 2014).
Participants can register for both the school and workshop (25 places)
or only for the workshop (no limit). To register for University of Tromsø
ECTS (BIO-8001 registration form) or a ForBio course certificate stating
the number of ECTS (no additional registration needed), participants have
to attend both the school and the workshop. As part of the course program,
each participant is required to (i) give a 12 minute talk about their
research during the evening sessions of the school, and (ii) present a
corresponding poster during the workshop.

Le paragraphe 10 est en : english
		- You need to be a ForBio member or associate.
             - Anyone can register as a ForBio associate. To register
               as a ForBio associate please visit the ForBio
               membership page
             - To become a ForBio member you must be registered as a
               PhD student or hired as a postdoctoral fellow at a
               Norwegian, Swedish, Danish, or Finnish university.
     - Now that you have a ForBio status (member or associate) you
       have to register to the school and/or the workshop itself by
       filling out the registration page.

==========================================
Le paragraphe 11 est en : english
	All participants attending both the school and workshop can receive a
ForBio course certificate stating the course description and number of
ECTS earned (2 in this case). If you would like to receive University of
Tromsø ECTS (2) instead of a ForBio course certificate, please feel out
the BIO-8001 registration form and follow the submission instructions on
it. If you have any questions about University of Tromsø registration,
please contact Sergei Drovetski (sdrovetski@gmail.com).
