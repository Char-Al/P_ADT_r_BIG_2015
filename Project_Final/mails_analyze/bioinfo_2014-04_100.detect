Subject : [bioinfo] [ECCB'14] Call for abstracts: Workshop on Disease Comorbidity


+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Le paragraphe 1 est en : ENG
	We are pleased to announce the ECCB'14 satellite workshop dedicated to "Computational and Systems Biology for Disease Comorbidities" that will take place Sunday, 7th September, 2014, in Strasbourg, France.

==========================================
Le paragraphe 2 est en : ENG
	The workshop will be organized around 3 sessions scoping the discovery, the interpretation and the exploitation of disease comorbidities. Key invited speakers will introduce each session and speakers selected from abstract submissions will broaden the overview of the science currently developed in this field.

==========================================
Le paragraphe 3 est en : ENG
	We deeply encourage you to submit abstracts to the workshop here:

	############# Workshop Description

==========================================
Le paragraphe 9 est en : ENG
	Disease comorbidity – or multimorbidity – exists if 2 or more disorders affect the same individuals more often than expected by chance. Such co-occurrence of diseases are the rule rather than the exception, in particular in ageing populations. Disease comorbidities hence represent a major burden in public health, and greatly affect disease costs and outcomes. But the recent expansion of large-scale biomedical databases and post-genomics disease-related datasets are now offering an unprecedented avenue for the investigations on comorbidities between human disorders. And Computational and Systems Biology are undeniable actors of such investigations.

==========================================
Le paragraphe 10 est en : ENG
	Session 1: Discovering Disease Comorbidities
The first session of the workshop will be dedicated to the different approaches that can lead to the detection of comorbidities between disorders, such as the parsing of clinical and epidemiological data.

==========================================
Le paragraphe 12 est en : ENG
	 
Session 2: Interpreting Disease Comorbidities
The second session of the workshop will be dedicated to the network-based approaches developed to interpret at the molecular levels the comorbidities between human disorders. Many data and multi-scale approaches studying the entangled molecular relationships between proteins, diseases and/or phenotypes rely on network representations. Phenotypes proximities between diseases can arise from mutations in functionally similar genes, for instance genes coding for proteins involved in the same pathways that are close in a protein interaction network.

Le paragraphe 14 est en : ENG
	  
Session 3: Exploiting Disease Comorbidities
A major interest for the study of disease comorbidities lies in the therapeutic road of drug repurposing (or repositioning). The knowledge on disease comorbidities could drive drug repositioning in a more effective way than systematic screenings. This assumption is the rationale of the last session.
