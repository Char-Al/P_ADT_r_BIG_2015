	Aim and Scope

==========================================
Le paragraphe 5 est en : english
	Bioinformatics and Bioengineering (BB) are interdisciplinary scientific 
fields involving many branches of computer science, engineering, 
mathematics, and statistics. Bioinformatics is concerned with the 
development and application of computational methods for the modelling, 
retrieving and analysis of biological data, whilst Bioengineering is the 
application of engineering techniques to biology so as to create usable 
and economically viable products.
Bioinformatics and Bioengineering are relatively new fields in which 
challenges and issues can often be formulated as optimization problems 
subject to multiple conflicting objectives. Such multiobjective 
optimization problems span from traditional problems, such as the 
optimization of biochemical processes, protein structure alignment and 
prediction, to more modern problems, such as directed evolution, drug 
design, experimental design, and optimization of manufacturing 
processes, material and equipment.
The main aim of this special session, which is organized within the 
SSCI-MCDM'14 Symposium, is to bring together both experts and new-comers 
working on Optimization Methods in Bioinformatics and Bioengineering 
(OMBB) to discuss new and exciting issues in this area.

==========================================
Le paragraphe 6 est en : english
	Topics of Interest

==========================================
Le paragraphe 7 est en : english
	We encourage submission of papers describing new concepts, strategies 
and challenges in the area of Bioinformatics and Bioengineering (BB). In 
addition, we are interested in application papers discussing the power 
and applicability of these novel methods to real-world problems in BB. 
You are invited to submit papers that are unpublished original work for 
this special session at SSCI-MCDM'14.

==========================================
Le paragraphe 8 est en : english
	The topics are, but not limited to, the following

==========================================
Le paragraphe 9 est en : english
	* Optimization methods for BB problems
* Novel optimization problems in BB
* Emerging non-standard problem challenges in BB problems (e.g. missing 
objective values, resourcing issues, dynamic changes, many objectives, 
large-scale, mixed-typed variables, etc.)
* Closed-loop optimization in BB
* Interactive multiobjective optimization in BB
* Predictive fitness landscape design for BB problems
* Integrating user preferences into multiobjective optimization of BB 
problems
* Handling practicalities in BB problems, such as uncertainty, noise, 
constraints, fixed budget of evaluations, high computational costs, etc.
* Robustness in the optimization of BB problems
* Visualization techniques for complex BB problems
* Adaptation, learning, and anticipation in BB problems
