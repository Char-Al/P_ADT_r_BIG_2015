==========================================
Le paragraphe 5 est en : ENG
	The 4 weeks program covers two topics of active research :
 
Term IJuly 15th to 25th : Bioinformatics
Term IIJuly 28th	to August 8th: Scientific Visualization

==========================================
Le paragraphe 6 est en : ENG
	Summer School Terms I and II are interdisciplinary courses and can be taken independently: students may enrol for either or both, however you are encouraged to take both. The courses consist of morning plenary sessions, afternoon numerical simulation hands-on activities and evening lectures.

==========================================
Le paragraphe 7 est en : ENG
	By participating you will discover, some aspects of current research in bioinformatics and scientific visualization, and you will get a thorough introduction to familiarize yourself with the mathematical and computational methods applied to these challenging topics.

==========================================
Le paragraphe 8 est en : ENG
	Term I: Bioinformatics is the application of computer science and information technology to the field of biology and medicine. Bioinformatics primarily focuses on developing computationally inten- sive techniques to increase the understanding of biological processes. This involves dealing with algorithms and computation theory, artificial intelligence, image and signal processing, discrete mathematics, con- trol and system theory, databases, information systems, and statistics.

==========================================
Le paragraphe 9 est en : ENG
	Term II: Scientific Visualization is the development of visualisation methods to advance knowledge in many disciplines including biology. With nowadays complex numerical simulations, scientists are in need of abstract, general-purpose analysis methods to improve their under- standing of the phenomena they have simulated. Real-time interactive visualization can serve as interpretation, help building hypothesis and reasoning. Active research areas in this topic involve information theo- ry, computer graphics, mathematics, physics, and cognitive science.

==========================================
Le paragraphe 10 est en : ENG
	This advanced training is open to young and brilliant science students (Licence L3, Master M1, M2) and does not require any prior knowledge in bioinformatics nor scientific visualization, other than a solid 3-years scientific university background. The number of participants is limited.

==========================================
Le paragraphe 11 est en : ENG
	To benefit from this training, students need to have a strong desire to learn and understand new concepts. There will be ample time for filling gaps in understanding. Instructors will be happy to exchange with the students, either in individual discussions or during tutorial sessions.
