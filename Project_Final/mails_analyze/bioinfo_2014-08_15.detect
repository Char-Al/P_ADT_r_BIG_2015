	Course description
This course is a standalone advanced Biostatistics course that can be  
taken as a continuation of the Introductory Biostatistics for  
Bioinformatics (IBSTAT) course that precedes it in GTPB. It is  
targeted for Biostatistical techniques often employed in analytical  
tools for high throughput data and multivariate data. Participants can  
expect to attend a thorough set of lectures that will reveal the  
conceptual frameworks that are needed to understand the methods.  
Extensive hands-on practice will be the main vehicle for providing the  
skills and user independence. To keep things in context, the course is  
exclusively based on biological examples, worked with Bioinformatics  
tools.
Care has been taken not to use any proprietary data or software, so  
that the hands-on experience can carry on after the course, providing  
maximum user independence. We will be using custom-built R scripts and  
packages that are available from the CRAN and Bioconductor repositories.

==========================================
Le paragraphe 9 est en : english
	Methodology
This intensive course will introduce a relatively high number of  
concepts and methods. To keep it highly practical, we will spend most  
of the time in hands-on sessions.
- We will focus on each method using examples taken from real world  
Bioinformatics practice.
- We will then dissect the method, identifying the concepts and  
exploring their interrelationships.
- The applicability and limitations of each method will be emphasized.
- The use of the method will be illustrated using appropriate  
Bioinformatics tools and biological data resources.

	Due to the summer period, there will be little time to deal with the  
applications, so the sooner you apply the better and we will do our  
best to make the acceptance process run smoothly. Early acceptance  
decisions will be the rule, not the exceptions, though you can help in  
justifying why you need to know about it in advance (please use the  
appropriate space in the Application Form).
