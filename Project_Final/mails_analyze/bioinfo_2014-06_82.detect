Le paragraphe 1 est en : ENG
	
High Throughput Image and Data analysis of cell division orientation

==========================================
Le paragraphe 2 est en : ENG
	The Computational Biology & Bioinformatic Platform and the Cell Division 
and Neurogenesis group (Institut of Biology of Ecole Normale Supérieure) 
are jointly seeking for a highly motivated post-doctoral researcher or 
research engineer in image and data analysis.

==========================================
Le paragraphe 3 est en : ENG
	The overall goal of this interdisciplinary project is to study the 
molecular regulation of mitotic spindle orientation in vertebrate cells, 
with a focus on the Gαi/LGN/NuMA molecular pathway. The lab has set-up a 
standardized spindle orientation assay in cultured cells in vitro, in 
order to perform a live RNAi screen for new modulators and effectors of 
this core pathway. The work will mainly consist in developing a system 
to perform analysis of thousands of image sequences of cell division 
generated in the live screen in a fully automated fashion.

==========================================
Le paragraphe 4 est en : ENG
	The candidate should hold a PhD degree in computer science and have a 
good background in image and data analysis (although candidates with a 
master degree showing promising ability will definitely be interviewed 
and should not hesitate to apply). A previous experience in a 
collaborative environment such as a research Institute in Biology would 
be considered a plus. The candidate should also have a good background 
in applied mathematics/statistics, a good English level and a perfect 
knowledge of a programming language such as Python, Java or R.

==========================================
Le paragraphe 5 est en : ENG
	The call will close on July 15, 2014. Future candidates will be selected 
and notified for an interview between July 15th and 31st, 2014. The 
starting date is October 2014. The position, funded by the Agence 
Nationale de la Recherche, is initially available for one year, with the 
possibility of further extension.

Le paragraphe 6 est en : FRA
	Applicants should send a CV, a motivation letter and contact details of 
2 references to:
