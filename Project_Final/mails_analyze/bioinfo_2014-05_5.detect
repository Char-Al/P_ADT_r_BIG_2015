                     ECCB Workshop W08
     Logical Modelling and Analysis of Cellular Networks

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

==========================================
Le paragraphe 2 est en : english
	Since the seminal publications of Stuart Kauffman and René Thomas about 40
years ago, logical modelling has been increasingly used to model the
dynamical behaviour of biological regulatory networks. However, behind the
common denomination &#8220;logical questions.
This workshop aims at providing an extensive and organised overview of
recent developments that render possible the modelling and the analysis of
large cellular networks, encompassing various signalling pathways,
sophisticate transcriptional networks, as well as novel regulatory
mechanisms (e.g. regulatory effects of miRNA, epigenetic regulations,
etc.). More specifically, the workshop will cover:
   &#8226; methods enabling an efficient analysis of signalling fluxes,
   &#8226; model reduction methods preserving relevant dynamical properties,
   &#8226; model checking methods for verification of temporal properties,
   &#8226; constraint/logical programming methods,
   &#8226; model composition for simulation of multi-cellular networks,
   &#8226; methods enabling the automatic refinement of models based on
     high-throughput datasets.
Invited speakers will refer to applications dealing with the control of
cell proliferation, cell differentiation and reprogramming, embryonic
development, immune response, and cancer drug resistance. They will
emphasise the biological insights gained with logical modelling in
general, as well as by using specific analysis methods.
Three to four slots have been reserved for contributed talks by young
researchers (PhD, postdocs), with limited support (registration waiving).
