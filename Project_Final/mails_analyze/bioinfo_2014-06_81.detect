Subject : [bioinfo] Postdoc positions at Inria in Lyon, France


+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Le paragraphe 1 est en : english
	Two postdoc opportunities at Inria in Lyon, France

==========================================
Le paragraphe 2 est en : english
	In the context of a FP7 KBBE European Project, BacHBerry (“BACterial 
Hosts for production of Bioactive phenolics from bERRY fruits"), we are 
seeking two postdoc candidates, each for one year, renewable for up 
to two years. 

==========================================
Le paragraphe 3 est en : english
	The candidates will work in the BAMBOO team at the Inria-UCBL in 
Lyon, France (http://team.inria.fr/bamboo/), in interaction with the
partners of BacHBerry, in particular the CSI team at the IDMEC-IST 
in Lisbon, Portugal (http://www.idmec.ist.utl.pt/). 

==========================================
Le paragraphe 4 est en : english
	Both BAMBOO and CSI are methodological teams with an expertise 
in computational and systems biology. 

==========================================
Le paragraphe 5 est en : english
	This project aims at tapping the potential of living organisms or systems 
to develop or make natural chemical compounds that are believed to be 
useful for medicine, agriculture, bioremediation, biodegradation, or etc. 
Most often, the compound is already produced by the organism but in 
small quantity, and one needs then to manipulate it in order for the 
production to be increased. Other situations require transplanting part of 
the chemical factory of an organism into another, in general a bacterium, 
for better efficiency. In some cases, the transplant might better be split 
among a community of different bacteria in interaction.

==========================================
Le paragraphe 6 est en : english
	BacHBerry is more specifically interested in the generation of bacterial 
platforms for sustainable bio-based production of phenolic compounds 
found in berry fruits. Phenolics are recognised for their antioxydant 
health-promoting and functional properties, and applied across 
applications as diverse as aromas, colours, nutraceuticals, and medicines.

==========================================
Le paragraphe 7 est en : english
	More specifically, we are looking for candidates with a PhD in one of 
the following areas: computer science, mathematics, statistics, computational 
biology, metabolic engineering, regulation, or related, with a strong taste 
for inter-disciplinary research, and with very good interpersonal skills. 

==========================================
Le paragraphe 8 est en : english
	Ideally, the person will have a long experience with graph algorithms,
discrete combinatorics and/or optimisation techniques.

==========================================
Le paragraphe 9 est en : english
	Unsual CVs are welcome. Knowledge of the portuguese language would 
also be a plus :-)

==========================================
Le paragraphe 10 est en : english
	Applications should include a motivation letter, a CV, and the address 
of three references. 

==========================================
Le paragraphe 11 est en : english
	The applications should be sent to:
Marie-France Sagot, marie-france.sagot@inria.fr
putting also in copy the partner in Lisbon:
Susana Vinga, susanavinga@gmail.com  
ideally before July 31, 2014.
