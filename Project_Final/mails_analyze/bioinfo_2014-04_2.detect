	The ŒTumor Identity Cards¹ (CIT) program aims at characterizing
extensively the genetic and epigenetic alterations in a variety of
cancers. The CIT program is based on a network of researchers and
clinicians involving over 50 teams from all over France. In the past 10
years, the CIT bioinformatics group has analyzed more than 10,000 samples
using a combination of high-throughput omics technologies (SNP, expression
and methylation arrays, miRNA and exome sequencing), leading to more than
100 publications (http://cit.ligue-cancer.net/?page_id=59). These studies
provide a basis to enable personalized medicine tailored to the genomic
characteristics of each tumor. This unique platform in France has a strong
expertise in bioinformatics and biostatistics, which will be crucial for
the success of this project.

	[Detailed Description of the Post-Doctoral Project]
BACKGROUND
The human tumour phenotype referred to as MSI (Microsatellite Instability)
is associated with inactivating alterations in MMR genes (Mismatch
Repair). MSI tumours develop through a distinctive molecular pathway
characterized by the genetic instability of numerous microsatellite DNA
repeat sequences throughout the genome. The MSI and MSS types
(Microsatellite Stable, also referred to as CIN for Chromosomal
Instability) are mutually exclusive and represent approximately 15% and
85% of colorectal cancer (CRC), respectively. Clinically, MSI colorectal
cancers (CRCs) have been reported to be poorly metastatic. They show
improved survival but bad response to 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU)-based
chemotherapy. The underlying reasons for these clinical characteristics
are poorly understood. To date, no specific therapeutic approach for MSI
colon tumours has been developed that takes into account their specific
mode of transformation.
MSI is expected to be oncogenic when it affects repeated sequences that
have a functional role. These last twenty years, studies from our group
and others have reported somatic mutations in Small Coding Repeats (SCR)
located within the sequences of various cancer-related genes in MSI
tumours (DNA repeats exceeding 8-10 bp in size are not observed in coding
sequences). These alterations are selected during tumour development when
they give selective advantage to the tumour cells in which they occur.
Besides the instability of SCR, MSI also affects Long Non-Coding Repeats
(LNCR) in cancer cells. Only a few of them are endowed with biological
activity. An example of this is with pre-mRNA splicing whereby a
mononucleotidic LNCR is located near the splice junction. To date, this
area has received very little attention. In our lab, we recently
identified a mutant of HSP110 (HSP110DE9) lacking the HSP110
substrate-binding domain in MSI CRC that was generated due to somatic
deletion in a LNCR (T17 intronic DNA repeat). We showed that the
shortening of T17 LNCR correlated with increased synthesis of an aberrant
HSP110 transcript due to exon 9 skipping. HSP110DE9 abrogated the
chaperone activity and anti-apoptotic function of HSP110 in a
dominant-negative manner. HSP110DE9 expression also increased the
sensitivity to anticancer agents. In agreement with these in vitro
findings, we demonstrated that the survival of patients with MSI CRC was
positively associated with the increasing size of somatic T17 deletions
due to MSI in CRC.

==========================================
Le paragraphe 11 est en : english
	AIMS OF THE POST-DOCTORAL PROJECT
In this project, we will aim at showing that MSI CRC is a splicing
pathology by identifying other frequent and clinically relevant splicing
aberrations in these tumours. Some LNCR may constitute obligatory hot
spots for insertion/deletion in MSI CRC cell and we hypothesized that
mutations at their level could be observed in future relevant therapeutic
targets and have a deleterious impact during tumour development (like with
HSP110). This last point is novel and original, suggesting that MSI might
not only constitute an oncogenic force but also a limit for colon cancer
development (in line with the clinical features of MSI CRCs, see above).
Our objectives are the following:
(1) To identify other aberrant splicing events due to MSI in CRC. Overall,
the aim of this project is to decipher the splicing aberrations due to MSI
in CRC and to find out new specific therapeutic targets which is an
important unmet medical need. This study will also help to identify the
sub-populations of CRC patients that would benefit most from either
classical or new personalized medicine depending on important somatic
genetic characteristics of their tumour. High throughput RNA Sequencing
(RNASeq) of 150 MSI colon tumours and paired adjacent normal mucosa
obtained from patients of the Saint-Antoine hospital is in progress at the
CNG (Centre National de Génotypage, France. Financial support: France
Genomics). Fifty MSS colon tumours and paired adjacent normal mucosa are
also analysed in the same conditions (controls) as well as a series of 10
CRC cell lines (5 MSI, 5 MSS). All data will be available and therefore
ready to be exploited for the present project before September 2014.
NB: the total sequencing volume expected after RNA sequencing of 300
paired normal/tumor samples is about 2813 giga bases (Gb).
(2) To check the functional link between MSI and some of the detected
aberrant splicing events. About 2000 human genes contain at least one
intron with LNCR very closely to the AG splice acceptor site at the
intron-exon junction. A preliminary screen we already performed using exon
arrays highlighted that at least one hundred were likely to be affected by
recurrent aberrant splicing events in tumour RNAs (mostly exon skipping;
experiments performed in a small series of CRC cell lines and primary
tumours. Unpublished). For retained exon candidates (e.g. those with
recurrent and specific aberrant profiles in MSI tumour samples as compared
to controls), allelic profiles of LNCR will be analysed using fluorescence
genotyping in the panel of MSI and MSS CRC cell lines and primary tumours,
as well as in control LBLs to assess their polymorphic status. As for
HSP110, we will then evaluated in each case whether the detected splicing
aberrations are MSI-driven or not (e.g. due to somatic deletions or
insertions in tumour DNA, see above our analysis of the T17 of HSP110);
(3) To identify the splicing events and/or LNCR mutations with clinical
relevance in MSI CRC patients. This will be done in a large cohort of 458
MSI CRC patients (frozen and/or paraffin tumour material together with
clinical data are already available; see our recent publication in the
field validating the role of HSP110 T17 deletions regarding response to
chemotherapy in CRC patients);
(4) Depending on results obtained, functional studies on a small number of
clinically relevant cancer-related genes whose splicing will be highly
perturbed due to MSI in cancer cells will be initiated. Like for HSP110,
we will particularly pay attention to mutant proteins that may constitute
future promising druggable therapeutic targets in MSI colon tumours.

==========================================
La phrase 70 est en : french
	NB: the total sequencing volume expected after RNA sequencing of 300
paired normal/tumor samples is about 2813 giga bases (Gb).
==========================================

	(2) To check the functional link between MSI and some of the detected
aberrant splicing events.
==========================================
La phrase 72 est en : english
	About 2000 human genes contain at least one
intron with LNCR very closely to the AG splice acceptor site at the
intron-exon junction.
==========================================
La phrase 73 est en : english
	A preliminary screen we already performed using exon
arrays highlighted that at least one hundred were likely to be affected by
recurrent aberrant splicing events in tumour RNAs (mostly exon skipping;
experiments performed in a small series of CRC cell lines and primary
tumours.
==========================================
La phrase 74 est en : english
	Unpublished).
==========================================
La phrase 75 est en : french
	For retained exon candidates (e.g.
==========================================
La phrase 76 est en : english
	those with
recurrent and specific aberrant profiles in MSI tumour samples as compared
to controls), allelic profiles of LNCR will be analysed using fluorescence
genotyping in the panel of MSI and MSS CRC cell lines and primary tumours,
as well as in control LBLs to assess their polymorphic status.
==========================================
La phrase 77 est en : english
	As for
HSP110, we will then evaluated in each case whether the detected splicing
aberrations are MSI-driven or not (e.g.
==========================================
La phrase 78 est en : english
	due to somatic deletions or
insertions in tumour DNA, see above our analysis of the T17 of HSP110);
(3) To identify the splicing events and/or LNCR mutations with clinical
relevance in MSI CRC patients.
==========================================
La phrase 79 est en : english
	This will be done in a large cohort of 458
MSI CRC patients (frozen and/or paraffin tumour material together with
clinical data are already available; see our recent publication in the
field validating the role of HSP110 T17 deletions regarding response to
chemotherapy in CRC patients);
(4) Depending on results obtained, functional studies on a small number of
clinically relevant cancer-related genes whose splicing will be highly
perturbed due to MSI in cancer cells will be initiated.
==========================================
La phrase 80 est en : english
	Like for HSP110,
we will particularly pay attention to mutant proteins that may constitute
future promising druggable therapeutic targets in MSI colon tumours.
