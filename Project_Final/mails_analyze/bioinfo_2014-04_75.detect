	Aim and Scope

==========================================
Le paragraphe 8 est en : english
	Modeling and analyzing networks is a major emerging topic in different 
research areas, such as computational biology, social science, document 
retrieval, etc. Nowadays, the scientific communities have access to huge 
volumes of network-structured data, such as social networks, 
gene/protein /metabolic networks, sensor networks, peer-to-peer 
networks. Most often, these data are not only static, but they are 
collected at different time points. This dynamic view of the system 
allows the time component to play a key role in the comprehension of the 
evolutionary behavior of the network.

==========================================
Le paragraphe 9 est en : english
	Handling such data is a major challenge for current research in machine
learning and data mining, and it has led to the development of recent
innovative techniques that consider complex/multi-level networks, 
time-evolving graphs, heterogeneous information (nodes and links), and 
requires scalable algorithms that are able to manage huge and complex 
networks.

==========================================
Le paragraphe 10 est en : english
	DyNaK workshop is motivated by the interest of providing a meeting point 
for scientists with different backgrounds that are interested in the 
study of large complex networks and the dynamic aspects of such 
networks. It aims at attracting contributions from both aspects of 
networks analysis: large real network analysis and modeling, and 
knowledge discovery within those networks.
