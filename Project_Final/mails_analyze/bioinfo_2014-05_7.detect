	Hosted by the International Society for Computational Biology (ISCB) and
the Centre for Genomic Regulation (CRG), the Next Generation Sequencing
Conference 2014 (NGS 2014) is a dedicated meeting on cutting-edge
approaches to the processing and analysis of Next Generation Sequencing
data. The goal of this conference is to bring together bioinformatics
researchers and biologists facing new high-throughput sequencing
challenges. The conference will feature presentations showing how
current platforms can be used to address key biological questions and
what is the current state of the art for data analysis. Sizeable space
will also be dedicated to emerging and future trends in high-throughput
sequencing and their associated computational challenges.

==========================================
Le paragraphe 8 est en : FRA
	Topics include:

==========================================
Le paragraphe 9 est en : ENG
	State of the art technologies, and technologies under development
Novel software and algorithms
Novel applications of NGS technologies in genomics and biology
Post genome sequencing analysis, including RNA analysis, transcription
factor binding sites profiling, histone modifications, nucleosome
positioning, copy number variation, genotyping, RNA structure, dynamics
of transcription and translation, etc.
Research breakthroughs based on exhaustive applications of NGS.
Clinical and translational applications
Applications to agriculture and biotechnology
Societal implications: forensic law, sociology research, history, etc.
Economical impacts
The conference will also aim to encompass the associated computational
challenges:

==========================================
Le paragraphe 10 est en : ENG
	Novel algorithms, methods and pipelines
Comparative benchmarks of methods
Hardware developments specific to NGS
High performance computing in NGS
Computation in portable NGS devices, micro- and nano-NGS devices
Computation during data acquisition
