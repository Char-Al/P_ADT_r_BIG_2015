	You will take part in a project, which aims to metabolically engineer chemicals in microbial chassis strains. The project comprises a design, a build and a test component and necessitates close collaboration between computational and wet laboratories. You will participate in the design task and be responsible for developing and deploying software based on chemical fingerprints and machine learning kernel methods to design reaction rules producing novel metabolic pathways.

==========================================
Le paragraphe 4 est en : english
	You will have a recent PhD in computational chemistry, computational biology or computer science. Essential qualifications include background knowledge in cheminformatics and/or bioinformatics, experience with machine learning and/or structure activity relationships, and excellent programming skills in languages such as C++, Java, Perl, Python, PHP, as well as scientific software (R or Matlab). Strong collaborative skills and the ability to work and communicate in a team environment are also required.
