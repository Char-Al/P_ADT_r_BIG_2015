	This is the third annual EISBM Symposium, following those organized in June 2012 on Knowledge Management for Translational Research and in June 2013 on the Philosophical and Engineering Foundations of Systems Biology. They gathered leading international experts and representatives of EU-FP7-funded consortia to review the state-of-the-art and the road map to foster the revolutionary transition from systems biology to systems medicine.

=======
Le paragraphe 9 est en : ENG
	This year the EISBM Symposium will highlight initial implementations of systems approaches in respiratory medicine and personalized healthcare and discuss the prospects for implementation of systems medicine in Horizon 2020.  The initial results of the plans presented last year to perform extensive individual monitoring of lifestyle and environment exposures, biological and clinical features integrated with deep genomics assessments will be reported.
