	Bonjour, 

==========================================
Le paragraphe 2 est en : french
	Vous trouverez ci-dessous 2 sujets de stage proposés dans le cadre du projet eTRIKS (European Translational Research Information and Knowledge Management Services : http://www.etriks.org/) à l'EISBM.

==========================================
Le paragraphe 3 est en : english
	Internship 1:
6-month Java Programming Internship: France & Luxembourg
Employer: CNRS
Website: http://www.eisbm.org/
Location: CNRS-EISBM, Lyon, France & LCSB, Luxembourg
Expires: 15/12/2014
Internship allowance: € 436.00 per month
Qualifications: Undergraduate - Bachelor's degree
Employment type: Temporary
Job hours: Full-time
Duration: 6 months
Starting date: Beginning of 2015
Key words: Programming, Java, graphical languages, network representation, Systems Biology

==========================================
Le paragraphe 4 est en : english
	An internship position is available as part of the eTRIKS (European Translational Research Information and Knowledge Management Services) project, funded by the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) of the European Commission 7th Framework Programme and the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations.

==========================================
Le paragraphe 5 est en : english
	The selected candidate will be based in Lyon-Gerland within the CNRS-EISBM team led by Charles Auffray, hosted by Claude Bernard University on the Charles Mérieux campus. For approximately 2 months the intern will be working in Luxembourg with our collaborators at the Luxembourg Center for Systems Biomedicine.

==========================================
Le paragraphe 6 est en : english
	The goal of this project is to develop a translator from Systems Biology Graphical Notation standard (file exported from CellDesigner software) into the LCSB MapViewer environment (Java). The translator will be developed in collaboration with LCSB Java programming experts. Prior knowledge in Systems Biology domain is not necessary.

==========================================
Le paragraphe 7 est en : english
	This is an excellent opportunity to get introduced into Systems Biology area and participate in a highly collaborative translational medicine project.

==========================================
Le paragraphe 8 est en : english
	Required Skills: Proficiency in Java programming and good communication skills in English.

==========================================
Le paragraphe 9 est en : english
	Recommended Skills: Knowledge of SQL and PostgreSQL would be helpful.

==========================================
Le paragraphe 10 est en : english
	Enthusiastic and motivated candidates are encouraged to contact Prof. Charles Auffray jobs@eisbm.org  with a CV and a brief description of their programming skills.

==========================================
Le paragraphe 11 est en : english
	Internship 2:
6-month Java Programming Internship: Lyon, France
Employer: CNRS
Website: http://www.eisbm.org
Location: CNRS-EISBM, Lyon, France
Expires: 15/12/2014
Internship allowance: € 436.00 per month
Qualifications: Undergraduate - Bachelor's degree
Employment type: Temporary
Job hours: Full-time
Duration: 6 months
Starting date: Beginning of 2015
Key words: Programming, Java, Graph Database, Neo4j, graphical representation, network representation, Systems Biology

==========================================
Le paragraphe 12 est en : english
	An internship position is available as part of the eTRIKS (European Translational Research Information and Knowledge Management Services) project, funded by the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) of the European Commission 7th Framework Programme and the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations.

==========================================
Le paragraphe 13 est en : english
	The selected candidate will be based in Lyon-Gerland within the CNRS-EISBM team led by Charles Auffray, hosted by Claude Bernard University on the Charles Mérieux campus.

==========================================
Le paragraphe 14 est en : english
	The goal of the project is to develop a code in Java for translating a graphical model in Systems Biology Graphical Notation (SBGN, www.sbgn.org) into the Neo4j Graph Database representation. Systems Biology Graphical Notation standard (SBGN-ML file format) is used for unambiguous biological network representation. Transformation into the graph database environment will allow easier access to various data, graph database querying and network analysis.
This position allows an intern to participate in a state-of-the-art EU systems biomedicine project.

==========================================
Le paragraphe 15 est en : english
	Required Skills: Proficiency in Java programming, good communication skills in English.
