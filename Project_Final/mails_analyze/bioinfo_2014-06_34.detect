	The CRG, the Centre for Genomic Regulation, is an international biomedical research institute of excellence, based in Barcelona, Spain, whose mission is to discover and advance knowledge for the benefit of society, public health and economic prosperity.
The breadth of topics, approaches and technologies at the CRG permits a broad range of fundamental issues in life sciences and biomedicine to be addressed. Research at the CRG falls into four main areas: gene regulation, stem cells and cancer; cell and developmental biology; bioinformatics and genomics; and systems biology.
With more than 350 scientists from 41 countries, the CRG excellence is based on an interdisciplinary, motivated and creative scientific team that is supported by high-end and innovative technologies. 
The SCImago Institution Rankings (SIR) World Report 2013, covering the years 2007-2011, classifies the CRG in 9th position (according to the Q1 indicator, health sector) out of over 2,740 research institutions around the world. In Europe only three other research centres in the health sector have a higher Q1 indicator.
The centre's other main strategic goals are: to translate basic scientific findings into benefits for health and economic value for society; to provide advanced and excellent training to our scientists; and to communicate and establish a bilateral dialogue with society.
