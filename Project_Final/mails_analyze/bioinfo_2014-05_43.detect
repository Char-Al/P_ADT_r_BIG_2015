	WORKSHOP

==========================================
Le paragraphe 2 est en : english
	"Sorting, Simulating, and Decoding Cells: Lineages, Networks, and Systems"
Marseille (France), July 1-2, 2014

==========================================
Le paragraphe 3 est en : french
	hosted by IMéRA Institute Méditerranéen de Recherches Avancées, Marseille
(France), http://www.imera.fr/

==========================================
Le paragraphe 4 est en : french
	Extended deadline: *May 30, 2014*

==========================================
Le paragraphe 5 est en : english
	Over the last decades, computer technology has changed the praxis of the
life sciences radically. Before computational biology, biologists employed
the microscopic eye, hands, paper and pen to observe, detail, order and
classify the mass of dividing and multiplicating cells into a system of
lines and connecting nodes. For example, by arithmetic tagging, which was
early introduced by botanists, the cell observers of the 19th century
traced each cell and its descendants, finally condensing the vast number of
dividing cells into the mapped figures of horizontal 'ball embryos' and the
vertical diagrams of cell lineage. These diagrams, the shape of which
partly resembles computational flow charts, became a convincing and
long-lasting visual argument for the cellular (and later genetic) processes
of biological development, comparable to regulatory genetic networks, the
time-lapse samples of video-microscopy, or maps of cell fate specification
nowadays. Both modes of graphic representation are mapped images, both
consist of parameters and data. However, the coded graphs generated by
computational software encompass an immense number of data, when compared
to the limited number of cells the biologists of the 19th century had to
identify.

==========================================
Le paragraphe 6 est en : english
	This IMéRA workshop will address the issues of (1) how to handle 'big
biological data' with the means of devices, practices, and models, and (2)
how to convert the information into knowledge and novel understanding of
biological development. Our main objective here is to contrast the most
recent visual representation of molecular cell biology, EvoDevo, and
computational systems biology to the manual visualization of comparative
embryology (or developmental history), classic cytology and (cyto)genetics
around 1900. For, we want to critically examine in which aspects the old
and new practices of data accumulation and analyses resemble to or differ
from each other.

==========================================
Le paragraphe 7 est en : english
	Instead of a textual abstract we prefer the proposal of a title,
supplemented by images, as we want to bring about an intellectually
stimulating and perspective discussion about the diverse modes of mapping
cells. The images/figures can be a historical one with an iconic
significance nowadays, an original or a redesigned figure, improving a
classic or well-established visualization. For, our intention is to
organize the workshop around visual and theoretical arguments on past and
present modes of cell mapping. We plan to print the best images for a
poster exhibition at IMéRA.

==========================================
Le paragraphe 8 est en : english
	We welcome contributions from young scientists and scholars from different
disciplines (e.g., life sciences, history and philosophy of science, or
history of technology, art history). To engage in lively debates, we are
especially interested in experimental, visual, conceptual and historical
contributions that elucidate and advance the issues and themes of our
workshop dealing with the experimental, conceptual and visual knowledge of
cells from the 19th century to the 21st century.

==========================================
Le paragraphe 9 est en : french
	Extended deadline for proposals: *May 30, 2014*.

==========================================
Le paragraphe 10 est en : english
	We will inform about the accepted proposals by early June, 2014.
