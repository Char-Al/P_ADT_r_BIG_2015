	MOTIVATION AND OBJECTIVES

==========================================
Le paragraphe 6 est en : ENG
	Scholarly publishing is increasingly enabling a new wave of applications that better support researchers in disseminating, exploiting and evaluating their results. The potential of publishing scientific papers enriched with semantic information is huge and raises interesting and challenging issues. Semantic Web technologies play a central role in this context, as they can help publishers to make scientific results available in an open format the whole research community can benefit from.

==========================================
Le paragraphe 7 est en : ENG
	The Semantic Publishing Challenge 2014 is intended to be the first in a series of events at ESWC for producing and exploiting semantic publishing data. The main focus this year is on extracting information and using this information to assess the quality of scientific productions.
Linked open datasets about scientific production exist - e.g. DBLP - but they usually cover basic bibliographic information, which is not sufficient to assess quality. Quality-related information are often hidden and not yet available as LOD. 

==========================================
Le paragraphe 8 est en : ENG
	There is also a growing interest in alternative forms of publishing scientific data as (semantic) datasets that can be more easily shared, linked to each other, and reasoned on. Alternative metrics for scientific impact are also gaining relevance.

==========================================
Le paragraphe 9 est en : ENG
	We are seeking the most innovative and impacting applications in this emerging contexts. 

==========================================
Le paragraphe 10 est en : ENG
	TARGET AUDIENCE

==========================================
Le paragraphe 11 est en : ENG
	The Challenge is open to everyone from industry and academia.

==========================================
Le paragraphe 12 est en : ENG
	TASKS

==========================================
Le paragraphe 13 est en : ENG
	The Challenge includes three tasks. Participants can participate in as many tasks as they like.

==========================================
Le paragraphe 14 est en : ENG
	= Extraction Tasks =

==========================================
Le paragraphe 15 est en : ENG
	We ask challengers to automatically annotate a set of multi-format and multi-source input documents and to produce a Linked Open Dataset that fully describes these documents, their context, and relevant parts of their content. The evaluation will consist of evaluating a set of queries against the produced dataset to assess its correctness and completeness. The input dataset will be split in two parts: a training/testing part and an evaluation part, which will disclosed a few days before the submission deadline. Participants will be asked to run their tool on the evaluation dataset and to produce the final Linked Open Dataset.

==========================================
Le paragraphe 16 est en : ENG
	== Task 1: Extraction and assessment of workshop proceedings information ==

==========================================
Le paragraphe 17 est en : ENG
	Participants are required to extract information from a set of HTML tables of contents, partly including microformat and RDFa annotations but not necessarily being valid HTML, of selected computer science workshop proceedings published with the CEUR-WS.org open access service. The extracted information is expected to answer queries about the quality of these workshops, for instance by measuring their growth, longevity, connection with other events, distribution of papers and authors.

==========================================
Le paragraphe 18 est en : ENG
	== Task 2: Extraction and characterization of citations ==

==========================================
Le paragraphe 19 est en : ENG
	Participants are required to extract information about the citations in scientific journals and their relevance. Input documents are in XML JATS and TaxPub, an official extension of JATS customized for taxonomic treatments, and selected from the PubMedCentral Open Access Subset and the Pensoft Biodiversity Data Journal and ZooKeys archive. The extracted information is expected to be used for assessing the value of citations, for instance by considering their position in the paper, their co-location with other citations or their purpose.

==========================================
Le paragraphe 20 est en : ENG
	== In-use Task 3: Semantic technologies in improving scientific production ==

==========================================
Le paragraphe 21 est en : ENG
	Participants are asked to submit demos that showcase the potential of Semantic Web technology for enhancing and assessing the quality of scientific production. 

==========================================
Le paragraphe 22 est en : ENG
	The task has a completely open structure and is, in particular, independent from tasks 1 and 2: participants are free to decide which tool to show and which dataset to use.

==========================================
Le paragraphe 23 est en : ENG
	The evaluation will be different from other tasks and will consist of two phases: after a first round of review, a number of submissions will be invited to demo their work at ESWC. The final decision will be taken at the Conference by a jury formed of PC members present at the event and other invited experts.

==========================================

==========================================
Le paragraphe 26 est en : ENG
	= Extraction Tasks 1 and 2 =

==========================================
Le paragraphe 27 est en : ENG
	Participants will be requested to submit the LOD that their tool produces from the evaluation dataset, as well as a paper that describes their approach. They will also be given a set of queries in natural language form and will be asked to translate those queries into a SPARQL form that works on their LOD.

==========================================
Le paragraphe 28 est en : ENG
	The results of the queries on the produced LOD will be compared with the expected output, and precision and recall will be measured to identify the best performing approach. Separately, the most original approach will be assigned by the Program Committee.

==========================================
Le paragraphe 29 est en : ENG
	= In-use Task 3 =

==========================================
Le paragraphe 30 est en : FRA
	Participants are required to submit a paper description as for tasks 1 and 2 and a demo version of the tool (open source appreciated but not mandatory).

==========================================
Le paragraphe 31 est en : ENG
	The evaluation will consist of two phases: after a first round of review, a number of submissions will be invited to demo their work at ESWC. The final decision will be taken at the Conference by a jury formed of PC members present at the event and other invited experts. The winner will be selected according to its potential impact, originality, breakthrough, the quality of the demo, and the appropriateness for ESWC.

==========================================
