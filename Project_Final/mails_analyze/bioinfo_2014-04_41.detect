Subject : [bioinfo] PhD position at INRIA Grenoble – DEVELOPMENT OF NOVEL ALGORITHMS FOR STRUCTURE-BASED DRUG DESIGN


+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Le paragraphe 1 est en : french
	PhD position at INRIA Grenoble - Rhône-Alpes, France

==========================================
Le paragraphe 2 est en : english
	DEVELOPMENT OF NOVEL ALGORITHMS FOR STRUCTURE-BASED DRUG DESIGN

==========================================
Le paragraphe 3 est en : english
	In the context of the INRIA 2014 recruitment campaign, a PhD position in the field of computational drug design is proposed at INRIA Grenoble, France.

==========================================
Le paragraphe 4 est en : english
	The overall subject of the PhD is to extend the state-of-the art methods for accurate modelling of protein–drug interactions. The PhD project will be conducted in the NANO-D team, which is funded through national, regional, and a European ERC Starting Grant (http://nano-d.inrialpes.fr). Algorithms developed during the project will be distributed with the SAMSON software platform created in the team.
The project consists in several tasks : 
* development of a reliable potential function for flexible drugs 
* development of new algorithms to explore the conformational space of flexible drugs 
* applying motion-planning methods to enhance efficiency of global search algorithms for protein–drug docking

==========================================
Le paragraphe 5 est en : english
	Candidates should posses 
* Strong computer science background
* Strong knowledge of applied math and physics
* Strong oral, written and interpersonal communication skills (working language: English – knowing French is a plus)
* Good knowledge of C++
* Ability to work independently and with a team

==========================================
